const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is diatomaceous earth?', answer: 'Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock made from the fossilised remains of diatoms — tiny aquatic organisms with silica-based shells. When ground into a fine powder, it has a wide variety of uses in agriculture, pest control, and household applications.' },
  { question: 'What does "food grade" mean?', answer: 'Food grade diatomaceous earth meets strict purity standards, containing less than 1% crystalline silica. It is safe for use around food, animals, and in agricultural applications. Do not confuse it with industrial-grade (pool-grade) DE, which is chemically treated and NOT safe for food contact.' },
  { question: 'How is diatomaceous earth used in the garden?', answer: 'DE can be dusted on plants and soil as a natural, non-toxic pest deterrent. Its abrasive microscopic particles damage the exoskeletons of insects like ants, fleas, bed bugs, and aphids. It works mechanically, not chemically, so pests cannot develop resistance.' },
  { question: 'Can diatomaceous earth be used for animals?', answer: 'Many farmers and pet owners use food grade DE as a natural supplement mixed into animal feed, or dusted on fur/feathers as a pest deterrent. Always use food grade DE around animals, never pool-grade. Consult your veterinarian for specific dosage guidance.' },
  { question: 'Do you ship diatomaceous earth across South Africa?', answer: 'Yes! We ship from Gauteng to all nine South African provinces. Bulk orders (10kg and 25kg) may qualify for discounted freight. We also export to Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and internationally.' },
  { question: 'How should I store diatomaceous earth?', answer: 'Store DE in a dry, sealed container. It has an indefinite shelf life as long as it stays dry. Moisture will reduce its effectiveness but won\'t make it go bad — just dry it out and it\'s good as new.' },
  { question: 'Is diatomaceous earth safe to handle?', answer: 'Food grade DE is generally safe, but the fine powder can irritate the eyes and lungs if inhaled in large quantities. Wear a dust mask when applying in enclosed spaces, and avoid getting it in your eyes. It is non-toxic and chemical-free.' },
  { question: 'What sizes do you sell?', answer: 'We offer food grade diatomaceous earth in 1kg (home use), 10kg (garden and homestead), and 25kg (farms and bulk users) bags. Contact us for larger wholesale quantities.' },

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a fine, off-white powder made from the fossilised remains of diatoms — microscopic aquatic organisms. These ancient organisms had shells made of silica, and over millions of years, their remains accumulated into thick deposits of soft sedimentary rock.</p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">When ground into powder, DE has remarkable properties: it's highly absorbent, mildly abrasive at the microscopic level, and completely non-toxic. This makes it invaluable for natural pest control, soil improvement, and many household applications.</p>
