const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis)?', answer: 'Spirulina is an oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacterium found worldwide in fresh and alkaline marine waters. It has been used for centuries as a staple food and is one of the densest known sources of complete plant protein, B-vitamins, iron, and the blue pigment phycocyanin — without significant side effects when consumed as food.' },
  { question: 'Why buy a live Spirulina culture instead of dried powder?', answer: 'A live culture lets you grow your own continuous, fresh supply for a fraction of the long-term cost. Fresh Spirulina also retains heat-sensitive nutrients (phycocyanin, enzymes, and certain B-vitamins) that degrade in commercial drying processes.' },
  { question: 'How long has your team been cultivating Spirulina?', answer: 'We have been cultivating Spirulina for over 20 years across pilot ponds, indoor tanks, and commercial-scale raceways here in South Africa. During that time we have refined our own feed fertilizer specifically formulated for Spirulina growth in local water and climate conditions.' },
  { question: 'What growing conditions does Spirulina need?', answer: 'Spirulina thrives in alkaline water (pH 9–10.5), warm temperatures (25–35 °C), bright indirect light, and gentle continuous agitation. It is naturally resistant to contamination because few other organisms tolerate its high-pH environment.' },
  { question: 'Do you supply schools, universities, and laboratories?', answer: 'Yes. We supply axenic and semi-axenic Arthrospira platensis starter cultures to schools, colleges, universities, research labs, and industrial buyers across South Africa, the SADC region, and internationally. Bulk and academic pricing is available on request.' },
  { question: 'Can I grow Spirulina at home?', answer: 'Absolutely. A 20–60 litre tank in a warm, bright spot is enough to harvest fresh Spirulina several times a week for a family. Our starter pack includes the live culture, growing instructions, and a starter dose of our proprietary feed fertilizer.' },
  { question: 'What is in your proprietary Spirulina feed fertilizer?', answer: 'Our blend supplies the nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, potassium, iron, and trace minerals Spirulina needs to maintain rapid, healthy growth in non-marine water. The exact formulation is the result of two decades of in-house optimisation and is supplied with full dosing instructions.' },
  { question: 'Do you ship live Spirulina cultures across South Africa?', answer: 'Yes — we ship live cultures from Gauteng to all nine South African provinces and export to Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and worldwide. Cultures are packaged to remain viable in transit for up to 7 days.' },
  { question: 'Is Spirulina safe?', answer: 'Spirulina has been consumed safely as food by humans for centuries and is recognised as a protein and vitamin supplement without significant side effects. As with any dietary change, consult your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have a medical condition. Disclaimer: Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.' },

            Spirulina Farming — Live Arthrospira platensis Culture
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis)</strong> is an oxygenic photosynthetic bacterium found worldwide in
            fresh and marine waters. This alga represents an important staple in the human diet and has been used as a
            source of <strong>complete protein and vitamin supplementation</strong> without any significant side
            effects. We supply <strong>live Spirulina cultures</strong> for farming, industry, home growers, schools,
            universities, colleges, laboratories and research — backed by <strong>over 20 years</strong> of hands-on
            cultivation in South Africa and our own purpose-built feed fertilizer.

          <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">What is Spirulina?</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Despite being commonly called a "blue-green alga", Spirulina is technically a cyanobacterium — one of the
            oldest photosynthetic life forms on Earth. Its spiral-shaped filaments contain up to <strong>60–70%
            complete protein by dry weight</strong>, all essential amino acids, B-complex vitamins (notably B1, B2 and
            B3), iron, magnesium, and the powerful blue antioxidant pigment <strong>phycocyanin</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Because Spirulina grows in highly alkaline water that few competing organisms tolerate, it is one of the
            cleanest and easiest microalgae to cultivate consistently — making it ideal for everyone from kitchen-counter
            growers to commercial producers.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For more than two decades we have cultivated Spirulina across small indoor tanks, greenhouse ponds, and
            outdoor raceway systems. Through that journey we have learned what generic textbook protocols leave out:
            how local water chemistry, seasonal sunlight, dust, and African summer heat affect culture stability — and
            how to keep ponds productive year-round.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            That experience is built into every culture we ship. You receive a vigorous, locally-adapted strain plus
            written guidance drawn from real-world South African conditions, not a translated overseas manual.
