  { question: 'What is a SCOBY?', answer: 'SCOBY stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. It\'s the living culture used to ferment sweetened tea into kombucha. It looks like a thick, rubbery pancake and grows a new layer with each batch.' },
  { question: 'Can I brew kombucha with rooibos tea?', answer: 'Yes! Rooibos kombucha is a uniquely South African drink. Our Rooibos Kombucha SCOBY is specifically adapted to ferment rooibos tea, producing a caffeine-free, antioxidant-rich probiotic beverage.' },
  { question: 'How long does kombucha take to ferment?', answer: 'A typical first fermentation takes 7–14 days at room temperature, depending on the ambient temperature and your taste preference. Warmer climates (like many parts of South Africa) tend to speed up fermentation.' },
  { question: 'Do you ship SCOBY cultures throughout South Africa?', answer: 'Yes, we ship live SCOBY cultures to all provinces in South Africa from our base in Gauteng. We also export to Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and internationally.' },
  { question: 'How do I care for my SCOBY?', answer: 'Keep your SCOBY in freshly brewed, sweetened tea at room temperature. Feed it with a new batch of sweetened tea every 1–2 weeks. If taking a break, store it in a SCOBY hotel (a jar of kombucha) in a cool, dark place.' },
  { question: 'Is kombucha safe to drink?', answer: 'Kombucha has been consumed safely for centuries. However, it contains small amounts of naturally occurring alcohol and acids. Pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and children should consult a healthcare provider. Disclaimer: Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.' },
  { question: 'What does kombucha taste like?', answer: 'Kombucha has a tangy, slightly vinegary taste with light effervescence. The flavour varies by tea base — black tea kombucha is bold, green tea is lighter, rooibos is earthy and sweet, and coffee kombucha has a rich, complex profile.' },
  { question: 'Can I flavour my kombucha?', answer: 'Absolutely! After the first fermentation, bottle your kombucha with fruit juice, ginger, berries, or herbs for a second fermentation (2–3 days). This adds carbonation and flavour.' },

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage made by adding a SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) to sweetened tea. Over 7–14 days, the culture transforms the tea into a fizzy, tangy, probiotic drink loaded with beneficial organic acids, B vitamins, and live microorganisms.</p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">It has been enjoyed for thousands of years across Asia and Eastern Europe, and is now one of the fastest-growing health beverages in South Africa. Making kombucha at home is simple, affordable, and allows you to control the ingredients and sugar content.</p>
