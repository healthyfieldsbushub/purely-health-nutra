const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is a vinegar mother?', answer: 'A vinegar mother is a cellulose biofilm formed by acetic acid bacteria (Acetobacter). It converts alcohol (wine, cider, etc.) into acetic acid (vinegar) through natural fermentation. It looks like a gelatinous disc that floats on the liquid surface.' },
  { question: 'How do I make apple cider vinegar at home?', answer: 'Add your vinegar mother to raw, unpasteurised apple cider (or hard cider) in a wide-mouth jar. Cover with a cloth and leave in a warm, dark place for 2–4 weeks. Taste periodically — when it reaches your desired acidity, bottle it. The mother can be reused for the next batch.' },
  { question: 'Can I make vinegar from wine?', answer: 'Yes! Our red and white wine vinegar mothers are specifically designed to convert wine into vinegar. Simply add leftover wine to a jar with the mother culture and wait 3–6 weeks. It\'s a wonderful way to avoid wasting wine.' },
  { question: 'Do you ship vinegar mother cultures across South Africa?', answer: 'Absolutely. We ship from Gauteng to all South African provinces and export to Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and internationally.' },
  { question: 'How do I store my vinegar mother?', answer: 'Keep your mother in vinegar at room temperature. It doesn\'t need refrigeration. If you\'re not actively making vinegar, just leave it in a jar of vinegar with a cloth cover — it will remain viable for months.' },
  { question: 'Is homemade apple cider vinegar as good as store-bought?', answer: 'Homemade ACV is often superior because it\'s raw, unfiltered, and unpasteurised, retaining the live mother culture. Commercial brands are often pasteurised, which kills the beneficial bacteria.' },
  { question: 'How long does it take to make vinegar?', answer: 'Depending on temperature and alcohol content, vinegar typically takes 2–6 weeks to develop. Warmer temperatures speed up the process. The vinegar is ready when it tastes properly acidic and the alcohol smell has disappeared.' },
  { question: 'Can I use the vinegar mother indefinitely?', answer: 'Yes! Like kefir grains, a vinegar mother is a living culture that continues to grow. It will produce new layers with each batch, and you can share the extras or start multiple jars simultaneously.' },

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">A vinegar mother is a living colony of acetic acid bacteria (primarily Acetobacter) that converts alcohol into vinegar through aerobic fermentation. It forms a cellulose mat on the liquid surface and is the key ingredient in traditional vinegar-making. The mother is what makes raw vinegar "alive" — it contains beneficial bacteria and enzymes that pasteurised vinegar lacks.</p>
