const faqs = [
  { question: 'What are natural probiotics?', answer: 'Natural probiotics are live beneficial microorganisms found in fermented foods and cultures. Unlike probiotic supplements (which are manufactured), natural probiotics come from traditional fermentation processes — kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, yogurt, and other cultured foods.' },
  { question: 'Why choose live cultures over probiotic capsules?', answer: 'Live cultures from fermented foods provide a broader diversity of beneficial bacteria and yeasts compared to most supplements. They also come with additional nutrients (vitamins, enzymes, organic acids) created during fermentation. Plus, once you have a living culture, it provides probiotics indefinitely.' },
  { question: 'Which probiotic culture should I start with?', answer: 'For beginners, water kefir is the easiest — it requires only sugar water and produces a delicious fizzy drink in 24–48 hours. Milk kefir is also simple if you consume dairy. Kombucha takes longer (7–14 days) but is very rewarding.' },
  { question: 'Are fermented foods safe?', answer: 'Fermented foods have been consumed safely by cultures worldwide for thousands of years. The acidic environment created during fermentation naturally inhibits harmful bacteria. However, always follow proper hygiene and fermentation guidelines. Disclaimer: Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.' },
  { question: 'Do you ship probiotic cultures across South Africa?', answer: 'Yes! We ship all our live cultures from Gauteng to every province in South Africa. We also export to Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and internationally.' },
  { question: 'Can I give fermented foods to children?', answer: 'Many families worldwide give small amounts of fermented foods to children. Start with tiny amounts and observe. Consult your paediatrician if your child has specific health conditions.' },
  { question: 'How do probiotics support gut health?', answer: 'Probiotics may help maintain a balanced gut microbiome, which research suggests plays a role in digestion, immune function, and overall wellbeing. A diverse microbiome — fed by a variety of fermented foods — is generally associated with better health outcomes.' },
  { question: 'What is the best probiotic for gut health in South Africa?', answer: 'There is no single "best" probiotic — diversity is key. Combining multiple fermented foods (kefir + kombucha + sauerkraut) provides a wider range of beneficial microorganisms than any single source. Our range of live cultures makes it easy to diversify your probiotic intake.' },

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">Natural probiotics are live beneficial bacteria and yeasts that occur naturally in fermented foods. For thousands of years, cultures around the world have relied on fermentation to preserve food, enhance nutrition, and support digestive health. Today, science is confirming what traditional wisdom has always known: a healthy, diverse gut microbiome is fundamental to overall wellbeing.</p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Rather than relying solely on manufactured probiotic capsules, you can grow your own probiotics at home using living cultures. Each fermented food provides a unique profile of beneficial microorganisms — and combining several gives you the broadest probiotic diversity.</p>
