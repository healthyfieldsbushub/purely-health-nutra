const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is a sourdough starter?', answer: 'A sourdough starter is a live culture of wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria maintained in a flour-and-water mixture. It acts as a natural leavening agent, replacing commercial yeast to produce bread with better flavour, texture, and digestibility.' },
  { question: 'How do I feed my sourdough starter?', answer: 'Feed your starter daily (or before each bake) by discarding half and adding equal parts flour and water by weight. For example: keep 50g of starter, add 50g flour and 50g water, mix well, and leave at room temperature for 4–8 hours until bubbly and doubled.' },
  { question: 'Can I use your starter for gluten-free bread?', answer: 'Our starters are wheat/rye-based and contain gluten. For gluten-free sourdough, you would need to create a separate culture using gluten-free flour. However, some people with mild wheat sensitivities find sourdough more digestible due to the long fermentation process that partially breaks down gluten.' },
  { question: 'How long does it take to bake sourdough bread?', answer: 'The process typically takes 12–24 hours from start to finish, including fermentation time. The actual hands-on work is only about 30 minutes — the rest is waiting for the dough to rise naturally.' },
  { question: 'Do you ship sourdough starter across South Africa?', answer: 'Yes! We ship live sourdough starters from Gauteng to all nine South African provinces. We also export to Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and worldwide.' },
  { question: 'How long will my sourdough starter last?', answer: 'With regular feeding, a sourdough starter can last indefinitely — some famous starters are over 100 years old! If you need to take a break, store it in the fridge and feed it once a week.' },
  { question: 'What is the difference between rye, wholegrain, and white sourdough starters?', answer: 'Each starter is cultivated with a different flour, which affects the flavour and character of your bread. Rye produces a deep, earthy loaf. Wholegrain gives a hearty, nutty bread. White creates a light, mild sourdough with an airy crumb.' },
  { question: 'Is sourdough bread healthier than regular bread?', answer: 'Many people find sourdough easier to digest than commercial yeast bread. The long fermentation process may help break down phytic acid (improving mineral absorption) and partially degrade gluten proteins.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">A sourdough starter is a living ecosystem of wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria, cultivated in a simple mixture of flour and water. Unlike commercial baker's yeast, these natural cultures develop complex flavours and produce bread with a characteristic tangy taste, chewy texture, and crispy crust.</p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Sourdough is one of the oldest forms of leavened bread, dating back thousands of years. The long, slow fermentation not only creates incredible flavour but may also improve the nutritional profile and digestibility of the bread.</p>
